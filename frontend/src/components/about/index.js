                <h1>About the Heresy</h1>
                <p>Nine years of experience has taught us two things:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Every aspect of EVE is inherently competetive.</li>
                        <li>It is generally better to play with friends than alone.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h2>Diplomacy</h2>
                <p>
                We keep an intentionally short list of blues to provide as much content as possible. We have a philosophy: aggress on grid and relax on comms.  Remembering that this is just a game, relaxing a little bit, and keeping cool in local means that every good fight is a networking event where we meet potential future fleet mates.
                </p>
                <h2>Candidacy</h2>
                <p>
                Though some of us have been playing for many years, we do not require candidates to be veterans. In fact, we enjoy teaching new pilots what we have learned throughout our years of experience. If you are willing to learn, we are willing to invest the time to teach you what you need to know to be successful.
                </p>
                <h2>Content</h2>
                <p>Many people love to debate about what type of game EVE is.  Is it combat game?  Is it a space simulator?  Is it a sandbox?  These questions miss the point.  Regardless of our opinions on game mechanics, the question <em>what is EVE</em> is more a question of mindset.  We chose to adopt a mindset that EVE is a game of <em>conquest and maintenance</em> that cannot truly be separated.  The guiding principle to any game is that we play to have fun.  From a practical perspective, we engage in warfare to acquire and protect our assets; and we engage in farming and production to produce and feed our machines of war.</p>
                <p>Flying with the Heresy, you can expect to be able to participate in these exciting activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Small and medium fleet engagements.</strong>  We enjoy the thrill of more strategic operations with differentiated roles.  Fleets of hundreds of pilots tend to resolve to the basic question of <em>who has more people pushing F1?</em>  We prefer the flexibility of using various types of electronic warfare, battlefield control, and other tactics to feel like the contributions of individual pilots actually matter in an engagement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Black Ops.</strong>  Who doesn't love the thrill of the hunt?  A covert cynosural field is always a disaster for somebody.  Whether it is executed correctly determines for whom it is a disaster.  Fortunatley, we have a proven track-record of success.  To date, all of our Black Ops engagements end ISK-positive for us.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Capital Skirmishes.</strong>  Sometimes it's necessary to wield a multi-billion ISK death machine and make someone have a <em>very bad day.</em>  It can be one of the most rewarding forms of combat in EVE.  Fortunately, most of our capital engagements tend to be against other similarly outfitted fleets of a few capital ships supported by a small gang of sub-capital ships.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Camps.</strong>  Sometimes a roam doesn't yield any results.  Sometimes you only have an hour and don't have time to go on a 100-jump round-trip through low security space.  Sometimes, after a long day you just want to sit back with a drink and go fishing.  Whatever the case may be, on those days, we have a few very active funnel gates that we camp.  It's a great opportunity to relax and get to know your fleet mates on comms.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Income Potential</h2>
                <p>
                In addition to the many PvP opportunities, we also engage in a wide variety of ISK-making ventures.  Even when just making ISK and playing against the environment, we typically prefer to work as a group to help pass the time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Team Abyssal Sites</li>
                        <li>Invasion Fleet</li>
                        <li>Level 5 Agent Missions</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                If passive ISK is more your style, we have a number of moons that we keep on a schedule that allows for nearly 24/7 mining potential, as well as facilities for reactions, invention, and manufacturing.
                </p>
                <h2>Hours of Operation</h2>
                <p>
                Our corporate peak activity hours are from 01:00 - 06:00 EVE Time, with secondary activity extending until around 09:00 EVE Time and alliance activity nearly 24/7.
